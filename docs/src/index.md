# TPLib.jl: Tropical Polyhedra Library

TPLib.jl is a binding to the library [TPLib](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~allamigeon/software/) which implements several algorithms to manipulate tropical polyhedra. Among others, it allows to compute:
* the extreme points and rays of tropical polyhedra, 
* tropical polar cones,
* the minimal representations by means of half-spaces,
* the tropical complex associated with a tropical polytope.
